                  So as we know time is important .every single second counts. there are using most of their time knowing the stock price again  and again. 

Solution: So we have come up with the Python Stock Analyzer Application that have  capabiity to analysis of stock and 
          give notification if the stock changes by 2 percentage. 
          
Technologies Used:
1)Python 3.7 - Programming Language 
2)Web Scraping -BeautifulSoup(bs4) and request API - Python Libraries 
3)pysttx and speech recognition(google) - Python text to speech and speech to text libraries of the python 
4)Visual Studio Code - Code Editor(IDE)

Todo 1)To add the UI to it. I mean moving it into an Application both mobile and desktop Application 
2)To add more efficiency on the kind of news using the Natural Language Processing(NLP) 
3) Make it available to the end users
